    I have prepared the enclosed report ``\reportTitle'' as my \term Work Report for my work term spent at \employer in \employerCity. This is my second work term report. The purpose of this report is to examine the problems associated with a popular technique used in application design known as a spriteSheet. I aim to convince anyone familiar with the ideas discussed to consider the solution I propose to solve these problems. This report uses the techniques I developed while tactling these problems but is targeted at a audience with a wider range of applications.

    \employer is currently working on a multi-platform video game. My supervisor, Elyot Grant, assigned me with overcoming some limitations of graphics API used.

    This report was written entirely by me and has not received any previous academic credit at this or any other institution. I give permission to \employer to keep a copy of this report on file and use it as necessary in the future.

% Conclusions
\newcommand{\conclusions}{
  \section{Conclusions}
  {
  \conclusion{Sprite Sheets limit the Features and Development of the Application}{
  Traditional sprite sheets are limited by the size of spriteSheet the GPU can handle. This indirectly encourages developers to only support specific resolutions, limit user control over graphics, and to reduce the visual complexity of the application to solve this problem.
  }
  }

% Recommendations
\newcommand{\recommendations}{
  \section{Recommendations}
  {
  \recommendation{Consider streaming all necessary assets from an external server.}{
  With dynamic sprite sheets, it is a good practice to store every graphic on an external server that can be downloaded by the application only once and cached. These individual files can be allocated to a dynamic spriteSheet only when needed, reducing memory, and improving performancing.
